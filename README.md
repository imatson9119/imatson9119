## Howdy 👋🤠🧗🏼🏊🏻‍♂️☕️🎹📚

My name is Ian Matson, and I'm a software engineer with a potentially unnatural desire to solve problems and hopefully learn something new along the way. I'm currently working in the AI labs at [Capital One](https://www.capitalone.com/) as a software engineer II, where I'm currently building a RAG-based agent assistance platform. 

Loud and proud alumni of [Texas A&M University](https://www.tamu.edu/), where I graduated with a degree in Computer Science.

### What I'm working on 👨‍💻
- 📖 [PeriCopy](https://www.pericopy.net): a diff-based Bible memorization tool
- 🤖 RAG-based Agent Assistance: current project at Cap 1
- 💡 [LED-Cube](https://github.com/elliotmatson/LED_Cube): A C-based LED matrix designed to sit on my desk and make people waste time
- 🍽 Dinner Club: _(Don't tell my friends yet please)_ An interactive puzzle-based website to prevent my friends from RSVPing to a fancy dinner I'm hosting.
